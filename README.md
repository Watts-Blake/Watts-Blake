### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Blake Watts!

Passionate about creating and learning and making an impact.
Videogame enthusiast, Bourbon connoisseur, take my dog in the mountains and explore type of person.

Former Firefighter, Business Owner, and Current Software Engineer.

I became a Software Engineer during the tail winds of covid. I was working as a home inspector for the business that I owned. 

I loved the work, the grind, and the reward of owning your own business, but the work itself wasnâ€™t something I was truly proud of doing, or that I was the slightest passionate about.

I decided to make a change. The tech field was something that i have always been interested in, but never really had an opportunity or the time to hop into.

I started off with a few online classes and realized quickly that I was getting addicted. So, I decided to sign up for App Academy's bootcamp and have not looked back.

Since then, I now have over one thousand hours invested into learning how to program and develop software. I am now fluent in Node.js, JavaScript, Python, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, MongoDB, Express, Flask, AWS, Socket.io, React/Redux, HTML, CSS, Git, and increasingly expanding my knowledge every day.

I am currently looking for a company where I can display my passion for my work and continue to learn on a day-to-day basis.
